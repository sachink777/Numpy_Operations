# Numpy_Operations

Numerical Python (Numpy) is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, 
various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast 
operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, 
discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
